# 🏠 House Price Prediction Using Machine Learning
## 📌 Project Overview

House price prediction is an important problem in the real estate domain, as property prices are influenced by multiple factors such as location, accessibility, nearby facilities, and house characteristics.

This project aims to predict house prices per unit area using machine learning techniques. Different models are implemented and compared to identify the most effective algorithm for accurate price prediction.

## 🎯 Objectives

* To build machine learning models for house price prediction
* To analyze the impact of location and structural features on house prices
* To compare the performance of multiple machine learning algorithms
* To assist customers in estimating house prices without relying on real estate agents

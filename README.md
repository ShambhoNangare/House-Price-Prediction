# House-Price-Prediction
This project focuses on predicting house prices based on various property and location-related features. The objective is to build an accurate regression model that helps estimate property values using historical housing data and machine learning techniques.

### Key Features
* Performed data cleaning and preprocessing to handle missing values, outliers, and inconsistent data
* Conducted exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand feature relationships and price trends
* Applied feature engineering techniques to improve model performance
* Built and evaluated multiple regression models to compare prediction accuracy
* Optimized model performance using appropriate evaluation metrics
